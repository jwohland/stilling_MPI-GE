The file found in this directory was generated using the script `code/preprocess/make_land_mask.py` and requires the file `mrro_Lmon_MPI-ESM_historical_r001i1850p3` to be downloaded from the [MPI-GE](https://esgf-data.dkrz.de/search/mpi-ge/) database and then only the first timestep accessed with CDO to produce `mrro_Lmon_MPI-ESM_historical_r001i1850p3_timestep1`, which is then stored in this directory.
